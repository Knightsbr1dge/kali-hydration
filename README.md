# kali-hydration
A basic bash script to configure Kali.
This script will pull in a number of git repos that I find useful when pentesing, as well as installing packages that I use regularly.

This is an on-going build and will be updated and tweaked as time goes on.

Feel free to use this as a base and tweak it to your own prefrences/liking.

This requires Kali 2020.4
